<div class="Myself">
  <p>
    As a mobile developer, I've been studying flutter on my own on Udemy, and landed an internship last year at Megabee Software company in Zahle<br>
    Since then, i didn't stop learning flutter in order to advance in this field, going from simple things like developing beatiful UI, to linking my app with firebase, and using the fields provided by firebase (firestore, authentication)<br>
    I also started clean code architecture using state managment and other topics, using provider to control stateful widgets, and started exploring the BLOC state managment since it's the most popular topic in this field.
    <br>
    I worked on many real life projects, like CaterMe, an online Saudi-based app for catering, and "YALLA JEYE", which i worked a bit in the front-end development.
    <br>
    Now i'm working in a supermarket to be able to continue my education, hoping one day i will become a successful developer and progress in my field
    <br>
    PS: this is only a demo website, and the design is pitiful but hopefully it will become better afterwards &#65
